# UnleashX-Synopsis
Creates a game synopsis view similar to what is used in [XBMC4Gamers][XBMC4Gamers] in UnleashX. This script creates a new menu in UnleashX that includes preview videos, artwork, screenshots and game information. (It should be run whenever you have added/moved/deleted games from your Xbox.)

## Disclaimer
Use this script at your own risk. I am not going to take any responsibility if this somehow renders your Xbox unusable.

## Usage
This script must be run from [XBMC4Gamers][XBMC4Gamers] after you have used the [XBMC4Gamers][XBMC4Gamers] artwork installer.
Copy the UnleashX Synopsis folder into your [XBMC4Gamers][XBMC4Gamers] system/scripts folder. Then you can run it from the settings/skin settings/scripts menu screen.

You may wish to use the config.xml file (replace your existing one which is located in the same folder as your UnleashX .xbe) and the icons that I've included (I can't remember where most of the Icons come from unfortuntely). If you don't use my config.xml you will most likely have to make some changes to config.py. The code assumes that all the icons are stored in F:\\Dash Icons. (Note: you do not have to use any icons if you don't want to.)

You must set the location of your UnleashX config file in config.py before using this script.
Please Read the information in config.py if you want to change the behaviour of this script.
If there are any errors read the xbmc.log file in your XBMC4Gamers system folder.

# Note: it is highly reccomended that you go in to your UnleashX video settings and enable texture compression to avoid crashes!
